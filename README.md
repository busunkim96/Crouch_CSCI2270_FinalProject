# Crouch_CSCI2270_FinalProject

# Project Summary:

Program compares non-balanced binary search trees and red-black BSTs using data from the US National Phenology Network (https://www.usanpn.org/home), which catalogues standardized ground observations of local fauna and flora by researchers, students, and volunteers. At the start of the program, the user will be given a choice as to which types of tree he or she would like to generate, and the code will then generate those types of tree with the same set of data. Each node in each tree will contain the common and scientific names of the species, the species ID, the phenophase (usually used to mean "the observable state in the lifecycle of an organism," but here valid for plants while animals are presented with current activities, such as "feeding" or "nest building (birds)") and the elevation, site ID(s), and date(s) at which the species was catalogued. the The user will be given the option of adding, deleting, or searching for an organism, with the number of operations taken to add, delete, or lookup for each tree being output each time. 

# suggested modifications: 
- implement json to help organize output for operations count per each type of tree
- implement rebalancing mechanism to transform unbalanced BST into RB BST
- implement rebalancing mechanism to transform unbalanced BST into AVL BST
